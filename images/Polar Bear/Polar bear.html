        <p>The polar bear is a large bear species found in the Arctic. They are known for their thick white fur and layer of fat that keeps them warm in icy conditions.</p>
        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>Polar bears primarily inhabit the Arctic ice caps and coastal regions, relying on sea ice to hunt for seals, their primary food source.</p>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>They mainly eat seals, but will also consume other marine mammals and birds if food is scarce.</p>
        <h3>Interesting Fact</h3>
        <p>Polar bears have a keen sense of smell and can detect seals nearly a mile away, even under several feet of compacted snow.</p>
