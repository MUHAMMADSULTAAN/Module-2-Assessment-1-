        <p>The giant panda is a bear species native to China, known for its distinctive black and white coloring. Pandas are primarily herbivorous, with bamboo making up most of their diet.</p>
        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>Pandas live in mountainous regions of central China, primarily in temperate forests where bamboo is abundant.</p>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>While pandas are technically carnivores, their diet consists of over 99% bamboo. They can consume up to 40 pounds of bamboo daily.</p>
        <h3>Interesting Fact</h3>
        <p>Pandas have a special adaptation in their wrist bones that allows them to grip bamboo while eating, making them efficient feeders.</p>
